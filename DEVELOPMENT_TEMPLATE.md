# Development Documentation Template

This file explains how to recreate useful development documentation that stays local and doesn't get committed to the repository.

## üìù **Recreate These Files Locally (Optional)**

You can create these files in your local development environment for easier testing and development. They won't be committed to Git due to `.gitignore` rules:

### 1. **QUICK_ACCESS_SUMMARY.md** - Testing credentials and endpoints
```markdown
# Quick Access Summary
## Demo Accounts
- vendor.free@demo.com / demo123
- vendor.pro@demo.com / demo123
- admin@demo.com / demo123

## Working Endpoints
- POST /api/auth/login
- GET /api/forms/vendor
- etc.
```

### 2. **API_TESTING_GUIDE.md** - API testing procedures
```markdown
# API Testing Guide
## Authentication Tests
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "vendor.pro@demo.com", "password": "demo123"}'
```

### 3. **FEATURE_ACCESS_GUIDE.md** - Feature testing by tier
```markdown
# Feature Access Guide
## Free Tier Features
## Pro Tier Features  
## Enterprise Tier Features
```

### 4. **DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md** - Personal development notes
```markdown
# Development Notes
## Database Schema Changes
## API Modifications
## Frontend Updates
## Deployment Notes
```

## üîß **Create Development Docs Script**

You can also create a script to generate these files:

```bash
# In your project root, create:
./scripts/create-dev-docs.sh
```

## üí° **Benefits of This Approach**

‚úÖ **Clean Repository** - Only essential files are committed
‚úÖ **Local Development** - Keep useful testing docs locally
‚úÖ **Team Flexibility** - Each developer can have their own notes
‚úÖ **Security** - No sensitive data in public repo
‚úÖ **Professional** - Public repo looks clean and polished

## üöÄ **Usage**

1. Create any of these files locally when needed
2. Use them for development and testing
3. They won't be committed due to gitignore rules
4. Share the template with team members who need them

**This approach gives you the best of both worlds: clean public repository + useful local development docs!**
